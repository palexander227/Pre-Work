I built an app like this with several students last semester as part of AP Computer Science principles. 

This is not quite as fully functional as I would like. The code derives in part from several sources on the internet which I did not have time to chase down, but fully 
acknowledge were major influences of the creative (possibly) use of the "forever loop" structures. 

Here is the link to my (still incomplete) version.
